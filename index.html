		<h3>Beginner Collector?</h3>
			<p>We all have to start somewhere, and it is often overwhelming to begin as a collector and be overwhelmed by so much information, high prices, and so many people telling you to watch out for the fakes, which seem to be everywhere these days. I have designed this website
			to help you join the hobby- where possible I have put information regarding common fakes, reproductions, and post war items. I hope this website helps you get into the hobby and make your research enjoyable. Please also have a look at my beginners dictionary to help you understand what all those confusing acronyms and German words mean. </p> 
		
		<h3>About This Site</h3>
			<p>This site was set up as a personal project in order to document and collate my research and information 
			regarding third Reich militaria- from field gear, to uniforms, to helmets.  It features a responsive, clean, 
			and modern design as well as a wealth of information and links to help you learn and develop your knowledge. Although this site does feature some of my own personal research, it also features links
			to other sites, and recommendations for books, which provide some of the best information out there for certain topics. </p>
		
		<h3>What Is A Reference Site?</h3>
			<p>A militaria "reference" site or book is used by collectors to learn about items, and compare their versions
			to those that others may have. Many excellent books and a few websites exist out there, however books can be
			very expensive to buy and the websites are often not in English, outdated, broken, or hard to find. </p>
		
		<h3>How To Use This Site</h3>
			<p>This site is simple to navigate or use, and works just as well on mobile as it does on desktop. When using the site you will notice certain text appears differently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Text marked like <abbr title="Information Will Appear Here">this</abbr> can be hovered over for further definition- for example, manufacturer codes, or abbreviations- abbreviations in particular being one of the things that confused me the most when I started 3 or so years ago. </li>
				<p></p>
				<li>Text marked like <a href="#" onClick="return false;">this</a> can be clicked to take you to its related article on the site. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope you find the site useful and wish you a good visit. If you see or find any issues with the site, or inaccurate information- please do not hesitate to use the "report a bug" feature which can be found in the contact information page here. Please also be aware:</p>					
			
			<blockquote class="blockquote" style="padding-left: 40px; font-size: 1.0rem">
				<p class="mb-0"><b>I do not in any way, shape, or form, support or admire the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany both before and during the second world war. The articles and information held on this site do not reflect my political opinions and are for historical & educational research purposes only. Much of the information we hold today about the inner workings of the third Reich wouldn't be known if it wasnâ€™t for the hard work of historians and collectors who began to collect militaria and documentation soon after the war had ended.</b> </p>
